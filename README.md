# Web Optimization (Project 4)

This is my take on the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Project 4: Web Optimization.

The goals:

1. Get a Pagespeed score of 90 or above for index.html (mobile and desktop)

2. Get a consistent frame rate of 60fps when scrolling on pizza.html

3. Get time to resize pizzas on pizza.html to less than 5ms

## Github

My code for this project is completely hosted on Github.

Github Repository: https://github.com/spinne/optimization

Github Pages: http://spinne.github.io/optimization/

### File Structur of the Repository

Development Code:

The development code is completely inside the /dev folder. 


Production Code:

The production code is completely inside the /dist folder. Which is also the 
code found inside the gh-pages branch of the repository.


.publish Folder:

This is a result of gulp-gh-pages, which I used to publish the contents of the
dist folder to my gh-pages branch.

## How to Run the Project

  1. Use Github Pages
  
  There is a live version of the distribution code running publicly on
  Github Pages: http://spinne.github.io/optimization/

  
  2. Create Your Own Repository
  
  Download the ZIP from https://github.com/spinne/optimization .
  Unpack it in a folder on your local system.
  Create a git repository in your local folder (git init).
  Create an orphant gh-pages branch and remove all files from it.
  ( -> For help see: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/ )
  Get Node and Gulp up and running in your local folder.
  Install the gulp dependencies. It might be enough to just install gulp-gh-pages.
  Run 'gulp deploy' in the command line.
  The (distribution version of the) project should now run at:
  https://your-githup-username.github.io/your-repository
  
  
  3. Host On A Webserver - In A Pinch!
  
  Download the ZIP from https://github.com/spinne/optimization
  Unpack it in a local folder.
  Upload the contents of the /dist folder to a folder on your webserver (FTP?).
  Use a browser to navigate to the folder on your webserver.
